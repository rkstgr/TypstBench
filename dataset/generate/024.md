Create a simple event schedule table with columns "Time", "Event", "Location" (do not emphasize). 
The table should include: 12:00-13:00, Lunch Break, 14:00-15:00, Workshop, Room A.
In the first data row, make the "Event" cell span both "Event" and "Location" columns showing "Lunch Break".

  [12:00-13:00], table.cell(colspan: 2)[Lunch Break],
  [14:00-15:00], [Workshop], [Room A]
)
