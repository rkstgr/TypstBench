Create a table with headers "Month" and "Sales" showing quarterly data: January: $45,000 / February: $52,000 / March: $48,000.
Wrap it in a figure with caption "Q1 Sales Report". Set the table headers to not repeat on page breaks (repeat: false). Add a label "sales-q1" to reference it later.

    [February], [\$52,000],
    [March], [\$48,000]
