Create a basic table with 4 columns. The first column should be auto-sized, the second should be 2cm wide, the third should be 40% of available width, and the fourth should fill the remaining space (1fr). Add headers "Item", "Price", "Discount", "Notes" and one data row with "Laptop", "$999", "10%", "Limited time offer".

#table(
  columns: (auto, 2cm, 40%, 1fr),
  table.header[Item][Price][Discount][Notes],
  [Laptop], [\$999], [10%], [Limited time offer]
)
