How can I change text color in nested texts?

I have a stack of 2 rectangles, and a text in each rectangle. The code is as follows:
```typ
#stack(
dir: ttb,
rect(width: 200pt, height: 80pt)[
    #text(size: 12pt)[This is the text(red)[first] rectangle with random text.]
],
rect(width: 200pt, height: 80pt)[
    #text(size: 12pt)[This is the text(red)[second] rectangle with random text.]
]
)
```
I am trying to change the color of the nested text (e.g text(size: 12pt)[This is the text(red)[first] rectangle with random text.]). Typst does not recognize the inner text and prints `text(red)[first]` with no color applied.

rect(width: 200pt, height: 80pt)[
    #text(size: 12pt)[This is the #text(red)[second] rectangle with random text.]
]
)
